# Largest palindrome product
# Problem 4
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

largest = 0

		total_s = total.to_s
		if total_s == total_s.reverse
			if total > largest
				largest = total
